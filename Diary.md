#May 30 - June 3

I obtained the LCD Display, after deciding not to use the segment display. The problem is, I am not sure how I would go about wiring this.
Though, that is a problem for next week.

The next goal is to utilize the UBMP4's built-in temperature sensors in MPLAB Xpress. 
By forking John Rampelt's "Analog Input" repository for the UBMP4, the temperatue sensors are enabled and ready to test.

#June 6 - June 10

The step after the temperature sensors involves figuring out how to wire the LCD Display to the UBMP4.
I know this will take a while, as there is a lot I don't know about how an LCD works with a micro-controller

#June 13 - June 17

Using a breadboard, the LCD is correctly wired to the UBMP4. 
Though, there is still a lot more to do.
I don't think it will be completed in time.

#June 20 - June 23

This is the final week and I still haven't gotten the current temperature to appear on the LCD, this isn't looking good.
I have to do as much as I can before I show this to the class on June 27th...
