May 30 - June 3

I obtained the LCD Display, after deciding not to use the segment display. The problem is, I am not sure how I would go about wiring this.
Though, that is a problem for next week.

The next goal is to utilize the UBMP4's built-in temperature sensors in MPLAB Xpress. 
By forking John Rampelt's "Analog Input" repository for the UBMP4, the temperatue sensors are enabled and ready to test.

June 6 - June 10

The step after the temperature sensors involves figuring out how to wire the LCD Display to the UBMP4.
I know this will take a while, as there is a lot I don't know about how an LCD works with a micro-controller

June 13 - June 17

I am still trying to wire the LCD to the UBMP4 with a breadboard. I am almost there, but the deadline (June 23) is fast approaching.
